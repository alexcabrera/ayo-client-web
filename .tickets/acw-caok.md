# First-time user onboarding flow for ayo offline client

Create a smooth first-run experience that guides new users to choose between cloud API providers or local LLM inference. Goal: WebLLM makes a great demo - most users will try local first before configuring API keys.

## Acceptance Criteria

- First-time visitors see modal/splash with clear choice
- Choice persists so returning users skip modal
- Users can change settings later
- File preview removed/hidden on mobile
- Mobile-responsive onboarding UI
